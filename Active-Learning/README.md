<h3>:tada::zap: This Repository contains the code for my experiments on Active Learning</h3>

![](https://github.com/DarshanDeshpande/Research-With-TF/blob/master/Active-Learning/Images/Active-Learning.png)

The diagram shows the basic concept of <b>Active Learning</b>. In the scarcity of labelled data, we can ask our model to create data for us. In this process, we correct it's errors and help it predict better
This technique has shown to be extremely beneficial for getting equal if not the better results than the standard passive learning method

The methods included in the trials are:
1. <b>Entropy based sampling:</b> Selecting samples with the highest loss value
2. <b>Incorrect prediction based sampling:</b> Selecting all samples which have been wrongly classified
